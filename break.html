      <h2 class="loud">NCVEC Form 605 &amp; FCC Form 605 Will Be Updated</h2>
      <p>From ARRL-VEC: The form NCVEC 605 and FCC form 605 will be updated (Federal requirement) to include a statement (check box) that the applicant has never been convicted of any felony.</p>
      <p>The FCC has indicated that all VECs must begin transmitting this additional data to FCC <strong>starting on September 7, 2017</strong>.  Use of older versions of these forms should be good until that date.  (If you are mailing in an older form to the FCC, make sure it is received and processed by that date.)</p>
      <p>If the answer to the basic qualification question (felony question) is YES,  submit as an exhibit a statement explaining the circumstances. The application will be off-lined (held) for a basic qualification review which FCC already does for other radio license services. The Wireless Telecommunications Bureau's Mobility Division stated that the fact that an applicant answers YES doesn't mean they will be denied a license.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, applicants are required to answer the question only if they are filing NCVEC Form 605 or FCC Form 605 for one of the following purposes indicated: New, Amendment, Modification (Upgrade or call sign change), or Renewal/Modification. The question does not have to be answered if the applicant is filling a renewal only or an administrative update to their license (change of address, name, email, etc.).</p>
      <p>This updated form will be available at our VE Sessions as soon as the supplies arrive from the VEC.  When electronic versions of NCVEC form 605 and the FCC form 605 become available they will be posted on the webpages. Out-of-date forms should be disposed of, and out-of-date forms submitted after 9/07/2017 may be subjected to delays or rejection.</p>
      <p>For more details, the ARRL website has the <a href="http://www.arrl.org/news/revised-fcc-form-605-will-ask-applicants-the-felony-question">full story</a>.</p>

      <h2 class="loud">The HENRY-1 High Altitude Balloon Launch</h2>
      <p>The HENRY-1 High Altitude Balloon Launch went off without a hitch (well, very few anyway) on Saturday, March 18th 2017. We felt it was deserving of a webpage, with an hour-by-hour narrative, photos, videos, and links to lots of sites with information about high altitude ballooning.  <a href="hab.htm" target="_blank">Read more...</a></p>
