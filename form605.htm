<p>
See <a href="http://www.arrl.org/what-to-bring-to-an-exam-session"> www.arrl.org/what-to-bring-to-an-exam-session </a> for what to bring to this exam session.  You will be allowed into the testing area a few people at a time (feel free to study, or talk outside it while waiting).  The fee is $15, payable in cash, or a check or money order made out to ARRL-VEC.  All personal belongings except a pen and two pencils must be powered off and stowed during your entire time in the testing area.  We have calculators we can loan to you.  It will take some time to grade and process your test(s), so be prepared to remain seated and wait quietly for us to finish.  We will tell you the results of your test(s) as soon as your paperwork is complete and (if you pass) give you your Certificate of Successful Completion of Examination (CSCE).
<p>
IMPORTANT:  If you need to leave the testing area before the examiners have finished with your paperwork and we can't spare an examiner to escort you, you will not receive a CSCE, and hence no license or upgrade (but your $15 will be returned).

<font size=+1 color="black">
In order to fill in the application form you must have an FRN number.  Although a Social Security Number can be used instead when applying for your license, we will only accept an FRN number on our form due to computer security reasons.  The "How to Get an FRN#" button below will give you the information you need to obtain an FRN.
