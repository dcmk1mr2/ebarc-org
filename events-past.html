					<div class="event-desc"><p>We will have a presentation on the Moxon Rectangle antenna. Invented by Les Moxon, G6XN, The Moxon is a stealthy gain antenna that's inexpensive and fun to build. It's a great Saturday antenna project, especially for new hams seeking their first gain antenna. The Moxon is especially attractive to hams who want to avoid purchasing more expensive towers and rotators and who desire a directional antenna. For their size, Moxons are high performance antennas that lend themselves well to the spirit of experimentation and easily be scaled for any band, HF to UHF.</p></div>

				</p>
				<div class="event-desc"><p>DXers thrill at a contact with an exotic and distant location like Heard Island or Turkmenistan, but you can hardly get more distant and exotic than the moon. Hams have been making contacts with other Earth-based stations by bouncing radio signals off the moon (EME) for many years. But with the advent of weak-signal digital modes like JT65 it no longer takes expensive equipment, gigantic antennas and powerful amplifiers to be successful. Gary Lauterbach, AD6FP, of the Stanford Amateur Radio Club has been doing EME for nearly 20 years. His presentation will include some history of EME as well as current activities; what bands, modes, and antennas are commonly used; and how to deal with tracking, frequency stability, doppler shift, and path losses. I'm expecting this will inspire some (or many) of us to try our hand at this exotic niche of ham radio. <a href="pdf/eme.pdf">EME Presentation</a></p></div>

						<div class="event-desc"><p>At our April meeting, Alan will explore the world of 3D printing. While not specific to ham radio, 3D printing certainly has a place in building components of a ham station. And since prices for 3D printers continue to come down rapidly, it's no longer only reserved for well-funded academic laboratories and big corporations. Come learn what can be done with 3D printers, not just in the realm of science fiction any longer. </p></div>

		</p>
		<div class="event-desc"><p>We'll explore digital modes with a high-level introduction to how digital modes work and what equipment one needs to run digital modes. Then we'll focus more specifically on the latest weak signal mode, FT8. When we're at the low ebb of a solar cycle or if you have very limited options for antennas then the weak signal modes may be just the thing for you. FT8 is amazing in its ability to complete a contact under the absolute worst propagation conditions, using low-gain antennas, and running just a few watts of power. It's no wonder the popularity of FT8 has soared in the few months it's been available. Future Digital Mode Workshops may explore some of the more established digital modes like PSK and RTTY and less frequently used modes like MFSK, Olivia, Domino, Contestia, etc.</p></div>

			<div class="event-desc"><p>This will be a continuation of the October workshop on antenna modeling with 4nec2. Bring your laptops with the software installed. We'll pick up where we left off, covering topics like using variables (symbols) to enable the powerful 4nec2 Optimizer. More than just modeling an antenna, the Optimizer can actually help you design an antenna. What's the optimal spacing of elements in your yagi to achieve the best F/B ratio, gain, closest match to 50 ohms? These are some of the things the 4nec2 Optimizer can help you determine. Time permitting we'll also cover how 4nec2 can help you design a matching network to achieve low SWR. We'll use an example antenna to illustrate the aforementioned topics, but feel free to bring your own antenna models - we can help you work on those as well.</p></div>

We will have a demonstration of some popular antennas scaled to 900 MHz that we developed for the Maker Faire. You will be introduced to antenna basics, designing and modeling/optimizing with 4NEC2 software. To get the most out of the event please bring a laptop with 4NEC2 installed.

								</p>
								<div class="event-desc">HAMSCI: Ham Radio Science Citizen Investigation is organizing a crowd-sourced data collection project to help analyze the effects of the August 21st 2017 solar eclipse on ionospheric radio wave propagation. Ionospheric paths will change throughout the day as the moon passes across the sun and different portions of the Earth’s ionosphere are affected. The Reverse Beacon Network (RBN) and similar systems like PSK Reporter and WSPRnet will be used to collect data about open propagation paths and signal-to-noise ratios. The concurrent Solar QSO Party (kind of a contest, but not exactly) will help encourage as many radio contacts as possible that day. Logs from the “contest” will be uploaded along with the RBN data. All of the collected data will be made available to academic institutes for analysis so we’re hoping to collect as much data as possible. There are many ways hams can participate in this data collection: being a node on the RBN using a standard receiver or an SDR, working the contest, etc. Check out Page 82 of the February ARRL's QST magazine for more information.

								<div class="event-desc">f you've seen any of RIch's presentations for EBARC before you'll know he's an avid DXer, covering topics like "Wire Antennas for DXing," "Low Band Antennas," "How I Made the DXCC Honor Roll," etc. With no new DX entities to work, and very few sunspots, Rich has still been keeping busy in amateur radio. This month's presentation will be on a universal remote antenna tuner that Rich dreamed up. He uses an Elecraft KPOD controller in an unorthodox way, pairing it with a RaspberryPi micro controller to run stepper motors that tune a remote analog antenna match (tuner). Very creative, out-of-the-box thinking and a lot of computer programming to make this thing work. He'll be doing a presentation on this topic at Pacificon in October, but you can see it here first - right in your own backyard. So please plan to attend the August meeting. <p></p></div>

We can talk about the computer design of the antennas and how they were constructed. A lot of research went into a kite design for our purpose. The kite antenna remained aloft for most of FD without attention.   We'll find out what our total score was and kick around ideas for next year.  <p></p></div>
