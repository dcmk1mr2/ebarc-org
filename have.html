      New to amateur radio or want to do more?  Here are some of the things we do on the air.  What do you do?
    <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">UHF/VHF Voice </div></div>
    <p>Most hams get started with a cheap handy talkie (HT - handheld or car mounted radio) .  A cheap radio can be had for about $25.  Great for short distance use off the grid or yacking  it up long distance on a repeater.  Check out our newsletter - <a href="news.html"> "The Blown Fuse" </a>for up to date information on local UHF/VHF nets. </p>

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">DX'ing</div></div>
  <p>If you want to talk or send information anywhere in the world this is for you.     Some of our members even helped with preparation for the Heard Island DXpedition.   See our Links page for DX'ing organizations and Heard Island. </p>

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">QRP'ing</div></div>
  <p>If you want to talk or send information  anywhere in the world with under 10 watts this is for you.   Because the low power equipment is small and light it's ideal for taking on hikes and expeditions.  See our Links page for QRP'ing organizations.</p>
  
  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Weak Signal Digital</div></div>
  <p>
  Some of the most exciting new things in amateur radio are going on in digital modes.  Digital modes are used from microwave down to the new LF (2200 m) and MF (630) bands.  Also popular with earth-moon-earth bounce.
