    <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">UHF/VHF Voice </div></div>
    <p>Most hams get started with a cheap handy talkie (HT - handheld) or car mounted radio.  A cheap radio can be had for about $25.  Great for short distance use off the grid or long distance on a repeater.  Mostly found on VHF (2 m) or UHF (70 cm). Check out our newsletter - <a href="news.html"> "The Blown Fuse" </a>for up to date information on local UHF/VHF repeaters and nets. </p>

  <section class="about">
      <div class="container">
  
  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">DX'ing</div></div>
  <p>DX is shorthand for "distance".  If you want to talk or send information anywhere in the world this is for you.   Your DX'ing skills will improve as you learn to deal with pile-ups and about HF propagation and antennas.  Some of our members have racked-up contacts ("QSOs") in more than 300 countries and entities.   Some of our members even helped with preparation for the Heard Island DXpedition.   See our <a href="links.html">links</a> page for DX'ing organizations and Heard Island. </p>
  
  
  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Contesting</div></div>
  <p>
    Radio can be a sport though the contacts are different.  Contesting is one of the great activities of amateur radio. It boosts your technical knowledge and improves your radio operating skills â€” helping make you a better amateur. 
    See our <a href="links.html">links</a> page and for contesting organizations. The ARRL has a <a href="http://www.arrl.org/contest-calendar">calendar</a> of contests.

  <p>
    See our <a href="events.html">Current Events</a> for opportunities to get out and use your radio to help your community.
    <a href="https://www.ww6or.com/">ORCA</a> </a>  in Oakland and <a href="http://nalco-ares-races.org/">NALCO</a> in Berkeley are highly focused on emergency services and have regular preparedness nets and activities.

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">QRP'ing</div></div>
  <p>QRP is shorthand for "shall I reduce power"?  If you want to talk or send information long distance using under 5 watts this is for you.  Because low power equipment is small and light it's ideal for taking on hikes and expeditions.  QRP equipment is often hand made either from inexpensive kits or from a magazine article, though there are plenty of off the shelf rigs.  Because it's low powered, antennas make a difference and will ecourage you to learn more about them.  
    See our <a href="links.html">links</a> page for QRP'ing organizations.</p>

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Digital Modes</div></div>
  <p>
    Digital modes use a computer to convert digital information to audio signals that are sent over radio waves. Data transfer includes chat, email, file transfer, images and even voice.   A computer sound card is used to connect the radio's audio to the computer.
    </p>

  <p>There are a number of digital modes popular today which include:
    <ul>    
      <li>HF Digital Text Chat - popular mode include  PSK, RTTY, Olivia, and many others.  For each mode there are many variations. These modes are usually found in dedicated sub-bands in the HF ham bands.</li>

      <li><a href="http://aprs.org/">Automatic Packet Reporting System</a> Also known as the Automatic Position Reporting System, this system is usually used to report positions of yourself, cars and boats, even high altitude balloons.  Usually found in the VHF band at 144.390 MHz but is used on other frequencies.  </li>
      
      <li>Digital voice is another fast moving area.   Known for very little background noise it is available in either HF or UHF/VHF.  There are a number of incompatible proprietary  systems  such as D-Star and System Fusion.  <a href="https://freedv.org/">FreeDV</a>  is an open source system that was developed for free use, mostly on HF. </li>
      
      <li> There are two microwave mesh network systems that are popular in the ham community.  You can do high speed data, video, file transfer, etc. over ham microwave bands using relatively inexpensive gear intended for WiFi.  Take a look at <a href="http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/">Broadband-Hamnet (HSMM-MESH)</a> or <a href="https://www.aredn.org/">Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network (AREDN)</a></li>
      <li>
        Be sure to get involved with the <a href=https:www.sfwem.net> San Francisco Wireless Emergency Mesh</a>
      </li>

    <li>Packet Radio is still a thing.  It provides the underlying support for APRS and can be used for BBSs, file transfer, email, and chatting.  Most packet radio  is over UHF/VHF/HF radios with speeds ranging from 1200 to 9600 bps.  <a href="https://www.winlink.org/WinlinkExpress">Winlink</a> Express also known as RMS Express provides email support for with support for HF/VHF/UHF.   <a href="https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf">Direwolf</a> is a popular software "soundcard" AX.25 packet modem/TNC and APRS encoder/decoder.</li>
    </ul>

   <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Weak Signal</div></div>
   <p>
   Some of the most exciting new things in amateur radio are going on in weak signal modes, a subset of digital.  Weak signals are used from microwave down to the new LF (2200 m) and MF (630) bands.  These new modes use a computer to chat between users. Weak signal modes permit long distance operation even if you are antenna restricted. As the name suggests low power gear can be used, reducing the cost of entry to QRP gear.     <a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html">WSJT-X</a> is the goto program for experimenting with weak signals.  The FT-8 mode is even becoming popular with contesters and DX'ers.  JT-9 is still the best for very weak signal.  Also popular with earth-moon-earth bounce, troposcatter, meteor burst and other modes.
   </p> 
   <p>
     Another interesting weak signal mode is WSPR <a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wspr.html"> - download software here</a>.  WSPR periodically sends a beacon to probe propagation paths with low power, typically less than 5 watts. The beacon contains the stations's call sign, Maidenhead grid locator and transmit power in dBm.  Stations can decode signals with S/N as low as -28 dB.  Decoded signals may be automatically uploaded to WSPRnet <a href="http://wsprnet.org/drupal/wsprnet/map"> - display map here</a>.

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Satellites</div></div>
  <p>
         Alan Bowker, WA6DNR gave a presentation on satillite operations April 2017. He has been a featured speaker at AMSAT Symposiums. Emily Clarke, N1DID, also gave a <a href="http://www.amsat.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Intro_sats.pdf">presentation</a> on amateur radio aboard satellites. Emily is on the board of AMSAT and one of the most knowledgeable people in this fascinating niche of amateur radio. There's lots of information on the <a href="https://www.amsat.org/">AMSAT website</a> about getting started with satellites .  Although you can get started with with a handheld antenna and a HT some satellite chasers get azimuth/elevation rotators to aim an antennas arrays or dishes using special software to track the satellites.  You can build your own station this way: <a href="https://satnogs.org/">SATNOGS</a>

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Radio Direction Finding or T-Hunting</div></div>
  <p>
    Radio direction finding (RDF) or T-hunting or fox hunting has been a hobby in the ham radio world for a long time.  If you've ever seen a car equipped with a big, crazy looking antenna, a square antenna array or people running around with funny antennas and radios, they are probably T-Hunting.  If it's a weekend it's probably hams and a weekday someone looking for a transmitter for another reason.
<p>
T-hunting is still a thing with communities of hunters.  In San Francisco there is <a href="https://qsl.net/sfthunt/rdf-sf/rdf-sf.html">rdf-sf</a> and there may be a club in your neighborhood.  The rdf-sf site is a great source of information and there's also <a href="http://www.homingin.com">Homing In</a>.  
  </p> <p>The rdf/sf group sponsors reqular T-Hunts in the San Francsico Bay area. Be sure to give it a try.</p>

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Hardware Tinkering, Making and Hacking</div></div>
  <p>
    Hams are the original hackers!  We've been taking things apart to learn how they work a long time.  Homebrewing has always been a popular ham tradition.  Hams have spent decades experimenting in search of the best antennas.  Check out the future of ham radio: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuJWUtX35Io&list=PL6D0CPBQoIVoDvqigYSd5_3AIvvYOkqPo"> Ham Radio Friedrichshafen - SDR Academy 2018 </a>
  </p>
 
  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Elmer'ing/Mentoring </div></div>
  <p>
  "Elmer"ing is shorthand for mentoring ham radio. Give back to the ham radio community by helping new hams get started.  If you're doing something new with radio we'd like to know about  it.  We're always looking for interesting presentations.
