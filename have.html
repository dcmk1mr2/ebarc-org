      New to amateur radio or want to do more?  Here are some of the things we do on the air.  What do you do?
    <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">UHF/VHF Voice </div></div>
    <p>Most hams get started with a cheap handy talkie (HT - handheld or car mounted radio) .  A cheap radio can be had for about $25.  Great for short distance use off the grid or yacking  it up long distance on a repeater.  Check out our newsletter - <a href="news.html"> "The Blown Fuse" </a>for up to date information on local UHF/VHF nets. </p>

      <div class="container">
  
  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">DX'ing</div></div>
  <p>If you want to talk or send information anywhere in the world this is for you.     Some of our members even helped with preparation for the Heard Island DXpedition.   See our <a href="links.html">links</a> page for DX'ing organizations and Heard Island. </p>
  
  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Emergency and Public Service</div></div>
  <p>
    See our <a href="events.html">Current Events</a> for opportunities to get out and use your radio to help your community.
  </p>

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">QRP'ing</div></div>
  <p>If you want to talk or send information  anywhere in the world with under 10 watts this is for you.  Because low power equipment is small and light it's ideal for taking on hikes and expeditions.  See our <a href="links.html">links</a> page for QRP'ing organizations.</p>
  
  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Weak Signal Digital</div></div>
  <p>
  Some of the most exciting new things in amateur radio are going on in digital modes.  Digital modes are used from microwave down to the new LF (2200 m) and MF (630) bands.  These new modes use a computer to chat, email,  file transfer and even send voice.   A computer sound card is used to connect the radio's audio to the computer. 

  <p>There are a number of digital modes popular today which include:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/k1jt/wsjtx.html">WSJT-X</a> is the goto program for experimenting with weak signals.  The FT-8 mode is even becoming popular with contesters and DX'ers.  JT-9 is still the best for very weak signal.  Also popular with earth-moon-earth bounce.</li>
    
      <li><a href="http://aprs.org/">Automatic Packet Reporting System</a> Also known as the Automatic Position Reporting System, this system is usually used to report positions of yourself, cars and boats, even high altitude balloons.  Usually found in the VHF band at 144.390 MHz but is used on other frequencies.  </li>
      
      <li>Digital voice is another fast moving area.   Known for very little background noise it is available in either HF or UHF/VHF.  There are a number of incompatible proprietary  systems  such as D-Star and System Fusion.  <a href="https://freedv.org/">FreeDV</a>  is an open source system that was developed for free use, mostly on HF. </li>
      
      <li>HF Digital Text Chat - these popular mode include  PSK31, RTTY, Olivia, and many others.</li>
      
      <li> There are two microwave mesh network systems that are popular in the ham community.  You can do high speed data, video, file transfer, etc. over ham microwave bands using relatively inexpensive gear intended for WiFi.  Take a look at <a href="http://www.broadband-hamnet.org/">Bradband-Hamnet (HSMM-MESH)</a> or <a href="https://www.aredn.org/">Amateur Radio Emergency Data Network (AREDN)</a></li>

    <li>Packet Radio is still a thing.  It provides the underlying support for APRS and can be used for BBSs, file transfer, email, and chatting.  Most packet radio  is over UHF/VHF/HF radios with speeds ranging from 1200 to 9600 bps.  <a href="https://www.winlink.org/WinlinkExpress">Winlink</a> Express also known as RMS Express provides email support for with support for HF/VHF/UHF.   <a href="https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf">Direwolf</a> is a popular software "soundcard" AX.25 packet modem/TNC and APRS encoder/decoder.</li>

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Satellites</div></div>
  <p>
         Emily Clarke, N1DID, gave a <a href="http://www.amsat.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Intro_sats.pdf">presentation</a>  on amateur radio aboard satellites. Emily is on the board of AMSAT and one of the most knowledgeable people in this fascinating niche of amateur radio. Lots of information on her website and links to other sites with <a href="https://www.amsat.org/">AMSAT</a> info.

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">High Altitude Ballooning</div></div>
  <p>
    EBARCS's HENRY-1 HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOON LAUNCH went off without a hitch (well, very few anyway) on Saturday, March 18th 2017. We felt it was deserving of a webpage, with an hour-by-hour narrative, photos, videos, and links to lots of sites with information about high altitude ballooning. Read more...

  <div class="section-thumb-container"><div class="section-thumb">Kite Antennas and Antenna Installation with Drones </div></div>
  <p>
    EBARC's Jack Burris K6JEB has been experimenting with kite antennas.  We used a verticle kite antenna on 80 m for Field Day 2017 and it worked great. Here his presentation <a href="pdf\Get-In-The-Air-Get-On-the-Air-What-You-Need.pdf">Parts for Kite Antenna</a></li>
