							<div class="event-desc"><p>We will launch a HAB from Orinda, chase it and hopefully recover the payload. We will be using APRS to track the payload. You can also follow it on APRS.fi. In theory we should be able to launch in the morning and look at the recovered photos over lunch. Sometimes the recovery can take longer and you should be prepared to be out for a while. Bring snacks and drinks.  More details to follow...</p>

									<span class="event-topic">September Meeting - Organizing a Mega VE Session</span></p>
									<div class="event-desc"><p>Our September meeting will feature our own Sharon Primbsch, AA6XZ. Her 
										topic is "Organizing a Mega VE Session."  Recently, lots of Bay Area Volunteer Examiners have come together several times to help the UC Berkeley Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) department.  The instructors are encouraging their students to (optionally) become licensed hams, so they can test what they build in class.  She'll describe what it took to get (and keep) these "Mega-Sessions" going. All the participants are delighted to be helping in (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) STEM education, in addition to furthering the amateur radio hobby.</p>

										<span class="event-speaker">Various Presenters</span><br>
										<span class="event-topic">October Meeting - Open Mic Night</span></p>
										<div class="event-desc"><p>Please join us to participate as well as listen as we do an "open mic" night where club members share a short story (~5 minutes) about one of their ham-related experiences.  A more detailed description (and example) will be featured in the September Blown Fuse.  We're hoping to get at least 10 people to share their stories with us but the more the merrier.  As well as being entertaining, this is a great way to get to know each other better than the simple "name, call, qth" introductions we do at the beginning of each meeting. Please email me (Peter, w6dei) and let me know if you'll participate.  Topics can be technical (how I built a qrp kit) or not (remembering my first Elmer) and don't need to be extensively rehearsed.  In fact, ad-lib, off-the-cuff stories are preferred.  If we don't get enough "volunteers" you will instead be subjected to a presentation on Maxwell's Equations and there WILL be a test at the end!  So let me know. Again, check the September Blown Fuse 
										for more info.</p>

				<div class="event-desc"><p>Astronomy… Okay, this isn’t exactly ham radio, but we do have several members who volunteer as docents at the Chabot Observatory and are working to arrange a presentation on what’s going on at that excellent local facility. Maybe some tips on viewing the aforementioned eclipse. Might include some radio-astronomy as well, just to make it a little more ham-relevant. But in any case, it should be very interesting whether it relates directly ham radio or not.</p></div>

			<div class="description">
				<p>EBARC has participated in the annual ARRL Field Day event for many, many years (always held on the last full weekend in June). This is one of the biggest and most enjoyed club events of the year.  While it's mainly about having a good time outdoors on the radio, Field Day is also an opportunity to give Ham Radio some exposure to the general public, practice emergency communications preparedness, and participate in a radio contest that's not quite as intense and competitive as most.</p>
				<p>Field Day is also a lot of work (enjoyable as the tasks may be).  We need people to transport and set up radio equipment and tents, keep everyone well-fed, provide security, interface with the public, and last but not least, get on the air and make as many contacts as you can.</p>
				<p>It's also a great opportunity to hone your radio skills, whether it's setting up and tuning antennas or operating at break-neck contest speeds.  And there are plenty of club members willing and able to help mentor these skills.  But the main goal at an EBARC Field Day is fun for all, so please plan to participate!</p>

				<p>We will be showing off some of our homemade radio gear and the magic of radio.  If you have something you'd like to display please consider bringing it to the Faire.  Last year we introduced a lot of people to ham radio. 
				The Makers Faire is a lot of fun with a variety of arts, crafts, DIY science and technology, creativity, craziness and fun for people of all ages.  The Park Day School in Oakland is a beautiful venue as well.  Please consider stopping by if you can.
